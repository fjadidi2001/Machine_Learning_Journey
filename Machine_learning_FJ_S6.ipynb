        "#Defines a simple K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier in Python. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Class Definition\n",
        "- **`class KNNClassifier`**: This defines a class named `KNNClassifier`, which implements the KNN algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Initialization Method (`__init__`)\n",
        "- **`def __init__(self, k=3, distance_func=None):`**: This is the constructor method that initializes an instance of the `KNNClassifier`.\n",
        "  - **Parameters**:\n",
        "    - `k`: The number of nearest neighbors to consider for making predictions. It defaults to `3`.\n",
        "    - `distance_func`: A custom distance function to use for calculating distances between points. If not provided, it will use the default Euclidean distance.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **`self.k = k`**: This assigns the number of neighbors (`k`) for the classifier instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`if distance_func is None:`**: This checks if a custom distance function was supplied.\n",
        "  - **`self.distance_func = self._euclidean_distance`**: If no custom function is provided, it sets the distance function to the internal method `_euclidean_distance`, which calculates Euclidean distance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Fitting the Model (`fit` method)\n",
        "- **`def fit(self, X, y):`**: This method is used to fit the KNN model to the training data.\n",
        "  - **Parameters**:\n",
        "    - `X`: The feature set (input data) used for training.\n",
        "    - `y`: The labels (output data) corresponding to the training features.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`self.X_train = X`**: This stores the training feature set in the classifier object for future predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Making Predictions (incomplete)\n",
        "Although the `fit` method is not fully visible in the code, we can infer that it would typically involve:\n",
        "1. Calculating the distance from a given test point to all training points using the specified distance function.\n",
        "2. Identifying the `k` nearest neighbors.\n",
        "3. Aggregating the labels of these neighbors (likely using majority voting).\n",
        "4. Returning the predicted labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "In summary, this KNN classifier class allows users to create a KNN model by specifying the number of neighbors `k` and optionally selecting a custom distance function. The `fit` method stores the training data for later use when making predictions, which would be based on the nearest neighbors' labels in the full implementation."
