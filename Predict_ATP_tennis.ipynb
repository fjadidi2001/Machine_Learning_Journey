        "1. **Exploratory Analysis of Player Characteristics**  \n",
        "   - Analyze the distribution of player ages, rankings, and Elo ratings across different surfaces (hard court, clay court, grass court).\n",
        "   - Identify trends in age and performance metrics to determine how they vary across court types.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Court-Type Specialization Prediction**  \n",
        "   - Build a classification model to predict a player's specialization (e.g., \"hard-court specialist,\" \"clay-court specialist,\" or \"all-rounder\") based on historical performance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Peak Performance Prediction**  \n",
        "   - Investigate the relationship between age and peak performance, specifically focusing on the \"Peak Age\" and \"Peak Elo\" features.\n",
        "   - Use regression techniques to predict a player’s peak Elo rating and the age at which they will reach peak performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Gender-Based Performance Analysis**  \n",
        "   - Conduct a comparative analysis of performance metrics between male and female players, examining if and how gender influences court-type specialization and peak performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Evaluation and Interpretability**  \n",
        "   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, mean squared error (MSE), etc., depending on the task (classification or regression).\n",
        "   - Incorporate interpretability techniques (e.g., SHAP values or feature importance) to provide insights into the factors contributing to a player’s peak performance and specialization.\n",

It could also provide insights into the ideal age for peak performance, which is valuable for athlete management and career planning."
