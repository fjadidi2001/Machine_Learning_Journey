> EA classification in machine learning refers to the process of categorizing data based on specific angles or channels, typically involving single-channel signal classification. In contrast, MA classification involves data collected from multiple channels, utilizing transmit and receive antennas. Essentially, classification in ML aims to identify patterns in data, allowing the model to sort new data points into predefined categories based on learned characteristics.
